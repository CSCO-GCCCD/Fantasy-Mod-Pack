URGENT: IGNORE THE DEV.TXT FILES THOSE WERE FOR FORMATTING ISSUES WITH THE FILES. DO NOT EDIT THEM OR REMOVE THEM
URGENT 2: IF I DO NOT MENTION A JSON FILE IN HERE THAT MEANS YOU DO NOT EDIT IT UNDER ANY MEANS.
What each Json Does:


First, every block and item must have their own unique Json in order to have their own unique block states,
there is a way to automate this but I have not done this yet.

Secondly, within each of these jsons you must declare

{
  "variants": {
    "": {
      "model": "tutorialmod:block/alexandrite_block"
    }
  }
}

This format is for blocks in minecraft and how to add them.

This is found in blockstates.

Next is Lang:
{
  "item.tutorialmod.alexandrite": "Alexandrite",
  "item.tutorialmod.raw_alexandrite": "Raw Alexandrite",



  "block.tutorialmod.alexandrite_block": "Block of Alexandrite",
  "block.tutorialmod.raw_alexandrite_block": "Raw block of Alexandrite"
}

this is the format, this is how you declare the name of the block and how it is spelt within the game this is what pops
up when you gain the item in minecraft.

Models:

Block
{
  "parent": "block/cube_all",
  "textures": {
    "all": "tutorialmod:block/alexandrite_block"
  }
}

This is the format for blocks that have all of the same textures for all sides. this would be in the block folder in
models.

Item:

{
  "parent": "item/generated",
  "textures": {
    "layer0": "tutorialmod:item/alexandrite"
  }
}

This is the format for items and their texture that appears in the game.

Textures:
This is where you upload the PNGs of the ITEMs and BLOCKs make sure you separate them. Put them in the respective folders
